nimsg -- Network Instant MeSsaGing
==================================
`nimsg` is a compact, server-based chat program written in Python 2.7.3.
This package assumes that you are working on a Unix-like system with `make` installed.  `nimsg` is able to run on other systems such as Windows, but only if you have Python installed and even then you might need a little tweaking.
To install `nimsg`, `cd` to the directory where you downloaded `nimsg`, and type in at a command line:
`make all`
`make install`

To run the `nimsg` client, type in at a command line:
`nimsg server_ip`
To run the `nimsgd` server, type in at a command line:
`nimsgd &`
